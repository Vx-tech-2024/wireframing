##Wireframing in real world scenario

During the wireframing phase of the Airbnb-clone project, user testing revealed key usability issues early. The “Book Now” button was hard to find, filters were cluttered, and the date picker confused users.
After adjustments — moving the booking button to a fixed spot, simplifying filters, and improving date highlights — navigation became smoother and bookings faster.
Wireframing helped catch design flaws before coding began, saving time and ensuring a clear, user-friendly interface that improved overall satisfaction.
